# VkHandybug

Debugger for the Atari Lynx emulator [Handy](https://handy.sourceforge.net/).

Based on ImGui, GLFW/Vulkan, reasonably cross platform (Linux - GCC 12.1, Windows - Visual Studio 2022).

To load symbols create file with the same name as the cart but with the .lbl extension.
The *lbl* file can be a Vice label file (generated by [cl65](https://cc65.github.io/doc/cl65.html) -Ln option) or simply be a list of "addr label":

```
  0034 here
  4ADE andhere
```
